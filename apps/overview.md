<h1 align="center">Building Apps for epilot</h1>

<p align="center">Welcome to the epilot Developer Platform! This comprehensive guide will help you create, publish, and maintain powerful integrations that extend the capabilities of the epilot platform—whether you're a new developer or an experienced partner.</p>

## What are Apps?
Apps on epilot are customizable extensions that enhance and expand the platform's core functionality. They serve as building blocks that allow developers to create tailored solutions for energy and utility companies without modifying the underlying platform.

At their core, epilot apps are modular integrations that can be developed, published, and installed by customers through the marketplace. Apps can include various components like custom journey blocks that guide users through specific processes, portal extensions that enhance user interfaces, and integrations with third-party services.
Each app functions as a self-contained package that can be versioned, updated, and configured by users based on their specific needs. 

Apps follow a standardized development and publication workflow, making it possible for both epilot's team and external partners to extend the platform's capabilities in consistent and maintainable ways.

Whether you're looking to create a simple integration or build a comprehensive solution, the epilot app framework provides the tools, APIs, and infrastructure needed to develop professional-grade extensions that solve real business problems in the energy and utility space.

## App Components on epilot

Apps on epilot consist of modular components that extend platform functionality in specific ways. Each component type addresses different integration needs and can be combined within a single app to create comprehensive solutions.
