## Request a developer sandbox account and start building your first App

The typical epilot portal is designed for production-ready use cases, where even small configuration errors could affect running systems. These errors might potentially result in data loss and diminished trust from end customers.

This is why epilot offers dedicated sandbox accounts. These environments are specifically created to allow developers to experiment with the platform in a safe space. A sandbox provides a limited but functional environment where you can configure and test various features without any risk to production systems.

### Your Path to App Development

Sandbox accounts serve as the perfect starting point for creating your first app in the epilot ecosystem. The general workflow is straightforward:

1. Request a sandbox account by submitting a request [here](https://portal.dev.epilot.cloud/request-sandbox)
2. Once your request has been reviewed and approved, sign up with the credentials provided
3. Navigate to the app creation page at https://portal.epilot.cloud/app/apps/configuration/new to begin building your first private app

### The Value of a Sandbox Environment

You might wonder why a separate account is necessary for development. A sandbox account provides several key benefits:

It creates an isolated version of your app where you can freely experiment. This isolation ensures that your development activities won't affect other users or systems within the epilot ecosystem. Think of it as your personal laboratory where experiments can safely take place.

The sandbox serves as a comprehensive playground where you can configure the app according to your specific needs and conduct thorough testing. You can push boundaries, try different approaches, and even make mistakes—all without consequences to production environments.

Initially, your app will only be available for installation within your own sandbox account. This limitation is actually beneficial during the development phase as it prevents premature exposure of your work.

Once you feel confident about your app's functionality and stability, you can request a formal review of a specific version. This review process is the gateway to making your app publicly available to the wider epilot community.

To learn more about the review process and how to submit your app for review, refer to the [Publishing](/apps/publishing/how-to) section.
