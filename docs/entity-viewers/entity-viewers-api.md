# Entity Viewers API

[[API Docs](/api/entity-viewers/#tag/Viewers)]
[[SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epilot/entity-viewers-client)]

The Entity Viewers API provides the capability to track user view-actions with entities. It offers endpoints to track when a user has seen an entity, downloaded a file and allows to mark an entity as unseen.
