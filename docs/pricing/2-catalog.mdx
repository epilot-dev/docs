# Product Catalog

The product catalog is the central repository for all products, prices, and tax rates. It serves as the foundation for [Journeys](/docs/journeys/journey-builder), [Orders](/docs/pricing/orders), and integrations with external systems.

## Catalog Features

All catalog entities support the full [flexible entity](/docs/entities/flexible-entities) feature set:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Search & Filter** | Full-text search and attribute-based filtering across products, prices, and taxes |
| **Relations** | Link catalog items to contracts, orders, opportunities, and any other entity type |
| **Custom Attributes** | Extend built-in schemas with organization-specific fields via the Entity Builder |
| **Workflows** | Attach approval workflows, lifecycle management, or automated processes to catalog entities |
| **Import / Export** | Bulk import and export of catalog data |
| **Multi-Currency** | Price products in any ISO 4217 currency |
| **Notes & Attachments** | Attach internal notes and files to catalog entities |
| **Metadata Access** | Full read/write access to underlying entity data via the [Entity API](/docs/entities/entity-api) |

:::tip
Use the Entity Builder in epilot 360 to extend catalog schemas with custom attributes specific to your business, such as commodity type, grid area, or regulatory classification.

## Public Catalog API

The Pricing API exposes a public catalog search endpoint for use in customer-facing applications:

```
POST /v1/public/catalog
```

This endpoint supports full-text search across the product catalog and is designed for use with [Publishable Tokens](/docs/auth/token-types) in client-side contexts such as embedded Journeys.

## Product Availability

Products can be restricted to specific locations or conditions using availability checks:

```
POST /v1/public/availability:check
```

Availability rules enable scenarios like regional tariff restrictions or location-based product filtering in energy retail workflows.
