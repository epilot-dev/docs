# Pricing Library

A library that provides pricing utility operations for Pricing Entities within the epilot Platform, such as calculation of price item totals and aggregated totals. The purpose of this library is to provide support for common pricing concerns to all our APIs, micro-frontends and epilot Journeys.

## Getting Started

Install the package:

```bash
yarn add @epilot/pricing
```

```bash
npm install --save @epilot/pricing
```

## Disclaimer

This library is published as an open-source package so that integrators and partners can build custom frontends and integrations with consistent pricing calculations. It is not intended to be used as a standalone product.
