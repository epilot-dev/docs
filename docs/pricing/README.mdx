# Pricing

epilot provides a full-featured pricing engine for the energy and utilities industry. It covers the entire commercial lifecycle: product modeling, catalog management, flexible pricing models, tax handling, coupons, order creation, and online checkout.

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Product Catalog** | Centralized catalog for products, prices, and taxes with search, filter, and import/export |
| **Flexible Pricing Models** | Per-unit, tiered volume, tiered graduated (cumulative), tiered flat-fee, and dynamic tariffs |
| **Composite Prices** | Bundle multiple price components into a single product offer (e.g., hardware + recurring service) |
| **Billing Periods** | One-time, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual recurrence with automatic normalization |
| **Tax Management** | Inclusive and exclusive tax modes, regional tax rates, automatic tax breakdowns |
| **Coupons & Discounts** | Fixed-amount and percentage-based discounts with optional promo codes and usage limits |
| **Order Management** | Full order lifecycle with automatic total computation and line-item management |
| **Online Checkout** | End-to-end sales flow from catalog to checkout via [Journeys](/docs/journeys/journey-builder) |
| **Product Availability** | Location-based and file-based availability checks for catalog items |
| **Multi-Currency** | ISO 4217 currency support with precise decimal arithmetic |

All pricing entities are built on the [flexible entity](/docs/entities/flexible-entities) system -- add custom attributes, attach workflows, and use webhooks to integrate custom pricing logic from external backends.

## Architecture

The pricing system consists of three layers:

- **Pricing API** -- Server-side order management, price computation, catalog search, and checkout. Wraps the Entity API with pricing-specific business logic (total recomputation, tax breakdowns, coupon application).
- **Pricing Library** ([`@epilot/pricing`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epilot/pricing)) -- Open-source TypeScript library for client-side and server-side price calculations. Used across epilot's APIs, microfrontends, and Journeys.
- **Entity API** -- Underlying storage for all pricing entities (products, prices, taxes, orders). See [Entity API](/docs/entities/entity-api).
