Pricing covers products, prices, taxes, orders, and payments on the epilot platform.

The portal provides UIs for modeling products, prices, and taxes with search, filter, and import/export support. All pricing entities are extendable -- add custom attributes on top of built-in ones, and use webhooks to integrate custom pricing logic from your backends.
