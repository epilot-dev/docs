Three core entities power epilot pricing.

## [Product](/api/pricing#tag/product_schema) {#product}

Products represent items you sell: physical goods, digital goods, services, or subscriptions.

A product can have multiple **price options** for different billing cycles and price points. Each option uses either a simple or composite price.

## [Price](/api/pricing#tag/simple_price_schema) {#price}

A price defines how much a product costs. Two types are supported:

- **[Simple](/api/pricing#tag/simple_price_schema)** -- a fixed amount, paid one-time or recurrently.

- **[Composite](/api/pricing#tag/dynamic_price_schema)** -- calculated from a set of component prices, which can span multiple products. Example: a wallbox price + a recurring fast-charging service fee.

## [Tax](/api/pricing#tag/tax_schema) {#tax}

A tax is a percentage applied to a price. Two modes:

- **Inclusive** -- the tax is included in the displayed price. A 100 EUR price with 20% inclusive tax displays as 100 EUR.
- **Exclusive** -- the tax is added on top. A 100 EUR price with 20% exclusive tax displays as 120 EUR.

Bind taxes to a jurisdiction by setting the **Tax Region**.
