# Static IPs

Enterprise customers can configure webhook integrations to send requests from a fixed set of static IP addresses. This enables firewall rules and IP allowlisting to restrict access to internal systems.

:::info
Static IPs are available on enterprise plans by request. Contact support to enable this feature.

## Configuration

To set up static IPs for webhooks:

1. Send epilot support the list of static IP addresses you want to allowlist
2. epilot provides you with a list of outbound static IPs to allowlist on your firewall
