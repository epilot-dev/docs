# Static IPs


Enterprise customers have the option to configure their webhook integrations to send requests from a predefined list of static IP addresses. This feature enables organizations to introduce stricter network-level security controls, such as firewall rules or IP whitelisting, to ensure that only trusted requests are allowed to access internal systems.

This can be particularly valuable for customers operating in secure environments or requiring compliance with internal or regulatory data protection standards.

This feature is only available upon request for enterprise plans. Please contact support to enable static IPs for your webhook configuration.

## How To Configure Static IPs

Requirements for configuring static IPs for webhooks:
- You need to own and send us the list of static IP addresses you want us to whitelist
- Once that is done we will provide you with a list of static IPs you can whitelist
