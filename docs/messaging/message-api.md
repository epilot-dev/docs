## Entities

Thread and message entity are stored as an entity. So they are handled by [entity operations](/api/entity).

### Thread

Thread contains many messages in a conversation. Messages with no replies yet are treated as threads with single message. Each thread must have the **topic** to identify the source.

### Message

Message entity stores data of an email: from/to/cc/bcc email addresses, subject, body, attachments,...

## Message Capability

Other entities can configure its schema defination to add Message capability:

- Message tab: List out all messages related to entity.

```json
{
   "name":"messages",
   "title":"Messages",
   "feature_flag":"ff_messaging_enabled",
   "ui_hooks":[
      {
         "hook":"EntityDetailsV2:Tab",
         "title":"Messages",
         "import":"@epilot360/messaging",
         "order":51,
         "requiredPermission":{
            "action":"message:view"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

- Quick action: Add **Write e-mail** button to **Quick Action**. 

```json
{
   "name":"customer_messaging",
   "title":"Messages",
   "feature_flag":"ff_messaging_enabled",
   "ui_hooks":[
      {
         "hook":"ActivityPilot:QuickAction",
         "icon":"email",
         "route":"?drawer=messaging",
         "order":15,
         "requiredPermission":{
            "action":"message:send"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
