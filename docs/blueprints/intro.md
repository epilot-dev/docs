**Blueprints** are an essential feature to package end-to-end epilot configuration into easily installable packages.

![Blueprints](/img/blueprints/blueprint-details.png)

Blueprints are intended to simplify the setup of epilot and radically reduce the time and effort required to go to market with specific industry use cases using the latest epilot features and best practices.

These packages can include a wide variety of connected epilot resources such as *[Products](/docs/entities/schemas-list#product), [Journeys](/docs/journeys/journey-builder), [Automations](/docs/automation/intro), [Workflows](/docs/workflows/intro), [Entity Attributes](/docs/entities/attributes), [Purposes](#), [Labels](#), [Email templates](/docs/entities/schemas-list#email_template) and [Document templates](/docs/files/document-generation)*.

Pre-made Blueprints incorporating latest industry best practices can be installed from the epilot Marketplace. Some examples:

- [Heat Pump Sales](https://marketplace.epilot.cloud/blueprints/edl-heat-pump)
- [Commodity Sales](https://marketplace.epilot.cloud/blueprints/commodity-b2c)
- [Solar System Installations](https://marketplace.epilot.cloud/blueprints/solar-b2c)
- [Registration of PV Systems](https://marketplace.epilot.cloud/blueprints/registration-of-pv-systems)
- [Registration of Grid Connections](https://marketplace.epilot.cloud/blueprints/hausanschluss-fernwarme)
