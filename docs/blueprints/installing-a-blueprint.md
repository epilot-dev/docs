## Installation from Marketplace

:::info

Blueprints are currently in closed **BETA** only available to selected customers.

:::

To install a blueprint from the Marketplace navigate to [Configuration → Blueprints → Marketplace tab](https://portal.epilot.cloud/app/blueprints).

Here you can search and discover blueprints tailored for common use cases, based on our experience in the energy market.

After finding the one that fits your business, click on “Install now”.

:::info

Installation of a Marketplace Blueprint is possible only in a Sandbox testing environment. If you don’t have a sandbox yet, check the [Sandbox documentation](/docs/blueprints/intro#sandbox).

:::

You have two options of installation:

- [One-click Install](/docs/blueprints/installing-a-blueprint#one-click-install)
- [Advanced Install](/docs/blueprints/installing-a-blueprint#advanced-install)

## Post-Installation Configuration

After a Blueprint is installed, some resources may still require additional setup before they can be fully used. In the list view, these resources appear with the **“Ready to use” toggle switched off**. You can also filter the list to quickly see which items are not yet marked as ready.

- In the list view, click the link next to the toggle to open a resource in a new tab.

- Define and save any changes needed for the resource.

- Return to the Blueprint overview and toggle the resource as ready to use.

- Marking a resource as ready is optional and is meant to help you keep track of configuration progress.

With **Custom Blueprints** you can combine available resources to create your own Blueprint. With that you are able to:

- Share your use-case with other orgs
