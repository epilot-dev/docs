## Installation from Marketplace

:::info

Blueprints are currently in closed **BETA** only available to selected customers.

:::

To install a blueprint from the Marketplace navigate to [Configuration → Blueprints → Marketplace tab](https://portal.epilot.cloud/app/blueprints).

Here you can search and discover blueprints tailored for common energy-market use cases.

After finding the one that fits your business, click on “Install now”.

:::info

Installation of a Marketplace Blueprint is possible only in a Sandbox testing environment. If you don’t have a sandbox yet, check the [Sandbox documentation](/docs/blueprints/intro#sandbox).

:::

You have two options of installation:

- [One-click Install](/docs/blueprints/installing-a-blueprint#one-click-install)
- [Advanced Install](/docs/blueprints/installing-a-blueprint#advanced-install)

### One-click install

After choosing “One-click install” the installation process will start automatically.

Depending on the number of resources included in the chosen blueprint the installation may take up to 5 min.

## Post-Installation Configuration

After a Blueprint is installed, some resources may still require additional setup before they can be fully used. In the list view, these resources appear with the **“Ready to use” toggle switched off**. You can also filter the list to quickly see which items are not yet marked as ready.

- In the list view, click the link next to the toggle to open a resource in a new tab.

- Define and save any changes needed for the resource.

- Return to the Blueprint overview and toggle the resource as ready to use.

- Marking a resource as ready is optional and is meant to help you keep track of configuration progress.

## Creation of Custom Blueprint

Besides installing a blueprint from marketplace, you are also able to create your own Blueprints.

With **Custom Blueprints** you can combine available resources to create your own Blueprint. With that you are able to:

- Organize use-cases

- Test combinations of resources in a sandbox

- Share your use-case with other orgs

---

To create a **Custom Blueprint**, go to Configuration → Blueprints and select the tab “Blueprints”.

On the bottom you will see “Create Blueprint”, click on it to start the creation process.

You will be presented with a screen that allows you to select Resources to include in your Custom Blueprint.

Click on “Add resources” to continue.
