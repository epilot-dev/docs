## Installing a Blueprint

:::info

Blueprints are currently in closed **BETA** only available to selected customers.

To manage and install Blueprints, navigate to the [Configuration > Blueprints](https://portal.epilot.cloud/app/blueprints) in the epilot portal.

To install a new Blueprint, click on "Install Blueprint" and choose the source for your Blueprint.

1. If you already have a Blueprint zip file, you can choose *Upload File*
1. Choose "Marketplace" to pick a Blueprint from the [epilot Marketplace](https://marketplace.epilot.cloud).
1. Or if you wish to copy resources from another epilot organization, you can choose *"Sandbox"*.

![Install Blueprint](/img/blueprints/install-blueprint.png)

After picking a blueprint from your source, epilot will show a preview (plan) of what will get added or changed in your organization as part of the Blueprint. 

**Note that at this point, no changes will be made to your organization and you can still review the Blueprint before installing it!**

After you have reviewed the changes, click on *Import Resources* to start the Blueprint installation.

![View Plan Step](/img/blueprints/view-plan.png)

The installation will take up to a few minutes to complete. 

After the installation is complete, you will see a list of all the resources that were installed, and can click on each one to view the details and edit the configuration.

We recommend that you test the Blueprint in a sandbox environment before installing it in your production organization.
