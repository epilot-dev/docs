All Notes created in Epilot are represented as Note Entities. For almost all cases, you're expected to use the dedicated Notes tab on the sidebar of related Entities, but some cases may require you to manipulate the Note Entity directly. For such cases, you can use the Note Entity table to filter and access Note Entities just like any other Entity.

## Note Entity relationships

Note Entities use the [default entity relationship model](/docs/entities/relations) to link themselves to other contextual entities, file attachments, and also to other Notes. This is what controls the hierarchical structure of Note threads.
