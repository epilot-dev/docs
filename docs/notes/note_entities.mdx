All notes in epilot are stored as Note entities. In most cases, use the dedicated Notes tab on the entity sidebar. When you need direct access, the Note entity table lets you filter and manage Note entities like any other entity type.

## Note Entity Relationships

Note entities use the [standard entity relationship model](/docs/entities/relations) to link to contextual entities, file attachments, and other notes. These relations control the hierarchical structure of note threads.
