Notes let you attach contextual information to other entities in epilot. **All notes are represented as Note entities**, accessible through the [Entity API](/api/entity#tag/entity_schema) and [SDK](/docs/architecture/sdk).

:::warning
Notes were previously available through the Notes Tab on the Entity View. That feature is deprecated in favor of **Notes as Entities** and the **Notes Capability** on the Entity sidebar, described in this section.

**Notes as Entities** is currently in closed **Beta**, available to selected customers only. General Availability will be announced soon.

## Using Notes from the Entity sidebar

### Accessing Notes from the Entity View

On any supported entity type, expand the sidebar and go to the **Notes Tab** to see all notes associated with that entity.

### Creating a new Note

Click **New Note** in the top-right corner of the Notes Tab. You can format your note with rich text, mention other users, add file attachments, and categorize with labels.

</video>

### Creating a comment on a Note thread

Click the **Comment** button at the bottom of any note to start a thread. Comment threads let you discuss a topic in detail without cluttering the parent entity context.

</video>

### Pinning Notes

Click the **Pin** button on any note to pin it to the top of the Notes tab for quick access.

</video>

### Searching Notes

Search notes on the current entity by content, mentioned users, or labels using the search input at the top of the Notes tab.

:::info
You can also filter notes globally through the Note entity table. See [Note Entities](/docs/notes/note_entities) for details.
:::

### Note file attachments

You can add file attachments to notes and comments. Attachments are stored as File entities and accessible through the [File API](/api/file).

## Configuring Notes notifications

New notes automatically notify users who are:

- Participating in the thread (created the note or replied at least once)
- Mentioned directly in the note or comment

To change notification preferences, go to **User > My Account > Notifications** and find the **Communication** section.
