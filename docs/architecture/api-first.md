# API First

:::info

As one of our core [engineering principles](https://github.com/epilot-dev/engineering-principles#api-first-we-design-software-with-apis), epilot is built API first, meaning the software is designed using concrete API contracts before implementation.

:::

We use machine readable standards to design and describe our APIs:

- [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/)
- [GraphQL schemas](https://graphql.org/)
- [TypeScript type definitions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Public API

Our core APIs are public and free to use for our technical partners and customers to build and extend our product for their own purposes.
