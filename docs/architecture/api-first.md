# API First

As one of our core [engineering principles](https://github.com/epilot-dev/engineering-principles#api-first-we-design-software-with-apis), epilot software is built API first, meaning the design of the software is done by creating concrete API contracts before implementation.

This is done using common, machine readable standards such as:

- [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/)
- [GraphQL schemas](https://graphql.org/)
- [TypeScript type definitions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
