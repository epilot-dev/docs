## Tech Stack

The portal frontend is a single-page web application (SPA) hosted on AWS CloudFront consisting of frontend microservices orchestrated by the [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) framework.

Most of our frontend codebase is written in React and Typescript but other frameworks such as Svelte are also used in parts of the application.

The epilot application backend consists of serverless microservices written mostly in Typescript and Python leveraging serverless AWS services such as Lambda, Step Functions, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge.
