# Capabilities

[[API Docs](/api/entity/#tag/Schemas)]
[[SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epilot/entity-client)]

Capabilities extend entity views with additional functionality. They are defined on a schema and hook into the UI as tabs, attribute groups, or action buttons. Each capability specifies a `name`, `title`, and a list of `ui_hooks` that control where and how the capability renders.

## Native Capabilities

The following capabilities are built into the platform and available to all entities:

### Order Table

The order table capability provides the ability to manage line items within the Order and Contract entities. These line items are made of products and prices and describe an item to be sold or quoted to an end-customer.
For further details on the structure of a `line_item`, please refer to our [Pricing API](/api/pricing) and check the Order Schema.

Order Capability basic structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "order_items",
    "title": "Ordered Items",
    "ui_hooks": [
      {
        "hook": "EntityAttributes:Group",
        "order": 1,
        "title": "Ordered Items",
        "component": "PricingItems"
      }
    ],
  }
```

Capability configuration to support hiding columns:

```json
  {
    "name": "order_items",
    "title": "Ordered Items",
    "ui_hooks": [
      {
        "hook": "EntityAttributes:Group",
        "order": 1,
        "title": "Ordered Items",
        "component": "PricingItems",
        "settings": {
          "columns": [
            {
              "field": "amount_subtotal",
              "visible": true
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
  }
```

The `settings.columns` property controls which columns are visible or hidden.

### Quoting

The quoting capability manages quotes and orders (`items`) within the Opportunity entity. Each quote or order links to Order entities that describe a set of items to be sold or quoted to an end-customer.

For details on the `items` field structure, see the [Pricing API](/api/pricing#tag/opportunity_schema) Opportunity Schema.

![Quoting Capability](/img/quoting-capability.png)

Capability configuration to support hiding columns:

```json
  {
    "name": "quoting_relations",
    "title": "Quotes & Orders",
    "ui_hooks": [
      {
        "hook": "EntityAttributes:Group",
        "order": 6,
        "title": "Quotes & Orders",
        "component": "QuotingItems",
        "expanded": false,
        "isCapability": true,
        "settings": {
          "display_grand_totals": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

The `settings.display_grand_totals` property controls whether grand totals are displayed. When enabled, recurrence-based totals are hidden.
