# Journey Builder

[[API Docs](/api/journey)]

To create delightful, easy-to-use journeys for end customers and partners, epilot provides a Flexible Journey Builder interface.

The Journey Builder is a WYSIWYG editor interface that allows you to build and edit your Journey using _Steps_ and _Blocks_.

## Embedding Journeys

Journeys can be shared within the epilot 360 portal to other users or embedded to 3rd party websites using a script snippet.

Script snippets for embedding can be generated directly from the Journey Builder:

## Journey Submissions

Journeys built using the Journey Builder always create [Submission entities](/docs/journeys/submissions) when a user completes them.

Automation and [Entity Mapping](/docs/automation/entity-mapping) are then used to create further business objects and automate the process of handling requests, opportunities or orders.

The Journey Builder provides helpful templates and default configuration to create useful post-Journey automations.
