The entire epilot platform is built around the concept of flexibility and customization. We believe that the best way to achieve this is by providing a set of UI components that can be used to build custom capabilities on top of the epilot platform.

The epilot UI components are built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). They are available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epilot/ui-components) and can be used in any React application.

All components are available in Figma at [@epilotdesign](TODO) on Figma Community.

## Storybook

The epilot UI components are documented using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). You can find the latest version of the Storybook at [https://base-elements.epilot.io](https://base-elements.epilot.io/?path=/story/welcome-getting-started-guide--page).

## Getting Started

To get started with the epilot UI components, you can install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install @epilot/ui-components/elements
```

You can then import the components in your React application:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@epilot/ui-components/elements/Button';
```
