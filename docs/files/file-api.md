# File API

[[API Docs](/api/file)]
[[SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epilot/file-client)]


Files in epilot are uploaded and managed through the [File API](/api/file).

## Downloading Files

The [`downloadFile` operation](/api/file#tag/files/operation/downloadFile) returns a temporary presigned S3 URL, which the client uses to download a file using the `GET` method.

```
GET https://file.sls.epilot.io/v1/files/4ffdc191-f32c-404a-8520-c403b7408afa/download
```

```json
{
  "download_url": "https://epilot-prod-user-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/66/3fe52f11-89d8-4482-a102-b060e9c4b328/Snapshot_202205147_140500.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5AGXFWQOZC655PER%2F20240307%2Feu-central-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240307T130430Z&X-Amz-Expires=900&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2..."
}
```

The `download_url` in the response is valid for 15 minutes and can be used to download the file using the `GET` method.

:::info

The `downloadFile` operation requires a valid access token to be present in the request.

:::

:::note

The `public_url` property of a file entity may also be used to download a file directly if the file is public. However the `downloadFile` operation works for both public and private files and is the recommended way to download files.

:::


## Uploading Files

The [`uploadFile` operation](/api/file#tag/files/operation/uploadFileV2) returns a temporary presigned S3 URL, which the client uses to upload a file using the `PUT` or `POST` method.

After uploading, the client should call the [`saveFileV2` operation](/api/file#tag/files/operation/saveFileV2) to save the uploaded file as an entity make it permanent.

Files that are uploaded but not saved expire and are deleted within 24 hours.

:::info

The `uploadFileV2` operation requires a valid access token to be present in the request. Use the `uploadFilePublic` operation to upload files for Submissions of public journeys.

:::

## Example Upload Flow

### Step 1: Call uploadFile to receive s3ref

```
POST https://file.sls.epilot.io/v2/files/upload
```

Body (application/json):
```json
{
  "filename": "example.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf"
}
```

Response (201):
```json
{
  "s3ref": {
    "bucket": "epilot-prod-user-content",
    "key": "123/temp/f5e1c2be-7392-4a0d-8c45-236743423733/example.pdf"
  },
  "upload_url": "https://epilot-prod-user-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/123/temp/f5e1c2be-7392-4a0d-8c45-236743423733/example.pdf?X-Amz-...",
  "public_url": "https://epilot-prod-user-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/123/temp/f5e1c2be-7392-4a0d-8c45-236743423733/example.pdf"
}
```

### Step 2: Upload your file using a PUT request

Use the returned `upload_url` to upload your file to S3.

> Hint: Make sure your Content-Type request header is set correctly!

```
PUT https://epilot-prod-user-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/123/temp/f5e1c2be-7392-4a0d-8c45-236743423733/example.pdf?X-Amz-...
```

Body (application/pdf):
```
(binary data)
```

Response (201):
```
(empty)
```

### Step 3: Call saveFileV2 to persist the file and create a File entity

```
POST https://file.sls.epilot.io/v2/files
```

Body (application/json):
```json
{
  "s3ref": {
    "bucket": "epilot-prod-user-content",
    "key": "123/temp/f5e1c2be-7392-4a0d-8c45-236743423733/example.pdf"
  },
  "filename": "example.pdf",
  "access_control": "private"
}
```

Response (201):
```json
{
  "_id": "ef7d985c-2385-44f4-9c71-ae06a52264f8",
  "filename": "example.pdf",
  "access_control": "private",
  "public_url": "...",
  "type": "document",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "size_bytes": 0,
  "versions": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

Note that the `public_url` property of the File entity is still present in the response, even if the entity has `access_control` set to `private`. For `private` the public URL is simply not accessible and will return a 403 response.

You can now attach the returned file entity id to your business entity as a relation to any attribute of type `file`, or the default `_files` attribute:

```json
{
  "_schema": "opportunity",
  // ...other entity fields
  "_files": {
    "$relation": [
      { "entity_id": "ef7d985c-2385-44f4-9c71-ae06a52264f8" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## External Files

In some cases, storing files on the epilot side is undesirable. For instance, when it would mean migrating a large document archive. In such scenarios, it is possible to skip the upload steps and utilize the `custom_download_url` property when saving a File entity.

```
POST https://file.sls.epilot.io/v2/files
```

Body (application/json):
```json
{
  "custom_download_url": "https://external-url.io?fileID=42",
  "filename": "example.pdf",
  "access_control": "private"
}
```

Response (201):
```json
{
  "_id": "ef7d985c-2385-44f4-9c71-ae06a52264f8",
  "filename": "example.pdf",
  "access_control": "private",
  "custom_download_url": "https://external-url.io?fileID=42",
  "type": "unknown",
  "size_bytes": 0,
  "versions": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

External files are then retrieved on the fly from epilot with a short-lived signature and streamed directly to the end user.
To verify the request is coming from epilot, use the [`verifyCustomDownloadUrl` operation](/api/file#tag/files/operation/verifyCustomDownloadUrl).

![External file download flow](../../static/img/file-custom-url-flow.png)

:::info

Requests to download external files come from the user's browser. All data from the response (including headers) can be viewed by the end user and as such should not contain any sensitive data, like internal tokens, apart from the file.

:::


## Updating Files

Modifying or saving new versions of File entities happens via the [`saveFileV2` operation](/api/file#tag/files/operation/saveFileV2).


## Deleting Files

Deleting files is done using the [`deleteFile` operation](/api/file#tag/files/operation/saveFile). When the file entity is deleted, the underyling S3 object is deleted permanently.
